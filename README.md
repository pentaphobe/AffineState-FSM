# AffineState-FSM - a ridiculously rudimentary and non-java-like java FSM library

1. This has nothing intentionally relating to Affine Transforms
2. It was going to be called "Hardy", as in "That's A FINE STATE you got me in" but apparently I mis-remembered the quote. (it's "another nice **mess**") [see here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIPfEBuA7HY)

## Background

Whipped this up mostly to compensate for the lack of basic state abstraction in [Processing](http://processing.org/) for a project I'm working on.


## Todo

Hoping to clean it up with:

- [ ] Annotations for convenience
- [ ] Proper state transitions
- [ ] More consistent architecture and methods
