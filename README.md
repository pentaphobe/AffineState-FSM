# AffineState-FSM - a ridiculously rudimentary and non-java-like java FSM library

1. This has nothing intentionally relating to Affine Transforms
2. It was going to be called "Hardy", as in "A fine state you got me in" but apparently I mis-remembered the quote.

## Background

Whipped this up mostly to compensate for the lack of basic state abstraction in [Processing](http://processing.org/) for a project I'm working on.


## Todo

Hoping to clean it up with:

- [ ] Annotations for convenience
- [ ] Proper state transitions
- [ ] More consistent architecture and methods
